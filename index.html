<h1> Afraid to Shoot Strangers</h1>

</p>Lying awake at night, I wipe the sweat from my brow</p>
</p>But it's not the fear, 'cause I'd rather go now</p>
</p>Trying to visualize the horrors that will lay ahead</p>
</p>The desert sand mound a burial ground</p>
</p>When it comes to the time</p>
</p>Are we partners in crime?</p>
</p>When it comes to the time</p>
</p>We'll be ready to die </p>
</p>God let us go now and finish what's to be done</p>
</p>Thy Kingdom come, thy shall be done on earth</p>
</p>Trying to justify to ourselves the reasons to go</p>
</p>Should we live and let live? Forget or forgive?</p>
</p>But how can we let them go on this way?</p>
</p>The reign of terror corruption must end</p>
</p>And we know deep down there's no other way</p>
</p>No trust, no reasoning, no more to say</p>
</p>Afraid to shoot strangers</p>
</p></p>Afraid to shoot strangers</p>
</p>Afraid</p>
</p>Afraid to shoot strangers</p>
</p>Afraid</p>
</p>Afraid to shoot strangers</p>
</p>Afraid</p>

<h1> Afraid to Shoot Strangers</h1>
<img src= 'https://mocah.org/thumbs/565780-iron-maiden.jpg'>
</p>Lying awake at night, I wipe the sweat from my brow</p>
</p>But it's not the fear, 'cause I'd rather go now</p>
</p>Trying to visualize the horrors that will lay ahead</p>
</p>The desert sand mound a burial ground</p>
</p>When it comes to the time</p>
</p>Are we partners in crime?</p>
</p>When it comes to the time</p>
</p>We'll be ready to die </p>
